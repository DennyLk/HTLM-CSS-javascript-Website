                        What 3 factors could have been done better?
                    </div>
                    <p class="text1">
                        First, user experience could be enhanced by making the site more intuitive and easy to navigate.
                        This could be achieved through careful planning and design, as well as testing with a diverse
                        group
                        of users.
                        <br>
                        Second, the site's performance could be optimized to ensure that it loads quickly and
                        efficiently. This could be done by minimizing the use of large images and other media files, and
                        by
                        using caching and other techniques to speed up the loading of pages.
                        <br>
                        Finally, the security of the
                        site and its users' personal information could be strengthened by implementing measures such as
                        encryption and secure login protocols.

                        What 3 factors am I proud of?
                    </div>
                    <p class="text1">
                        There are several factors that I am proud of when it comes to creating a website. First, I am
                        proud
                        of the design of the website. I put a lot of time and effort into making sure that the website
                        has a
                        clean and modern look that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate. I also made sure to
                        use
                        high-quality images and graphics to enhance the overall aesthetic of the website.
                        <br>
                        Second, I am proud of the content on the website. I worked hard to create informative and
                        engaging
                        content that is relevant to my target audience. I also made sure to include a variety of media,
                        such
                        as videos and infographics, to make the content more interesting and interactive.
                        <br>
                        Finally, I am proud of the functionality of the website. I spent a lot of time testing and
                        debugging
                        the website to make sure that it works smoothly and efficiently.To pinpoint specific parts, my navigation bar and 
                        slideshow of images are the two things I'm most proud of.
                        <br>
                        Overall, I am proud of the effort and thought that I put into creating a high-quality website.
