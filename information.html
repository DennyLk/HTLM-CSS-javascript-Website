        </div>
        <div class="text1">
            <p class="text">In order to rent a boat in Croatia, you must be at least 18 years old and have a valid
                boating license. If you are a foreigner, you must have a valid boating license from your home country.
                The license must be in English or accompanied by an official translation. In addition to a valid boating
                license, you may also be required to provide proof of insurance for the boat you are renting. It is also
                important to familiarize yourself with the navigation rules and regulations in Croatia, as failure to
                follow them can result in fines or other penalties. Sometimes we may have additional
                requirements, such as a minimum age or boating experience for specific boats.</p>
